This program is a simple CSV-formatted .txt file modifier.
It allows the user to edit a CSV-formatted .txt file by:
- deleting colums,
- swapping colmuns,
- forcing all fields stored in a column to be enclosed by quotation marks,
- changing the field separator
and then save data into a chosen path.
It was written for my OOP class project in the 2nd semester of IT studies at Warsaw University of Science's Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology.
